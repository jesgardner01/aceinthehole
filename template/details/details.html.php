The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p>

       <b><p>10k COURSE:</p></b> <p> The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p>

        <b><p>Splash n' Dash: </p></b> <p> Kids event for participants ages 4 to 15. This is a 100 yard swim and a 50 yard dash. It is free if an adult registers for an event otherwise it is $25.</p>
